# Workflows

Workflows are directories in `workflows/` that codify repeatable processes. Each workflow is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file (with YAML frontmatter) and any supporting files (scripts, assets, etc.). Each step's output can be referenced by later steps using `{{Step Name}}`.

## Discovering Workflows

There are two places workflows can exist:

1. **Local workflows** — in the `workflows/` directory on the local filesystem. These are workflows the user has created or installed. List the `workflows/` directory to find these.
2. **Shared/published workflows** — in the remote Obot registry. These are workflows other users have published (publicly or to the organization). Use `searchArtifacts` to find these.

**When the user asks about "shared workflows", "public workflows", workflows from other users, or wants to discover/find/browse available workflows they haven't installed yet, ALWAYS use `searchArtifacts` to search the remote registry.** Do not just list the local `workflows/` directory — that only shows what is already installed locally.

If the user asks to "list all workflows", "show my workflows", "which workflows are installed" or similar without specifying shared/public, find workflows by using the Glob tool (never Bash with find or ls) with pattern `**/SKILL.md` in the `workflows/` directory (do NOT include `workflows/` in both the path and the pattern — that double-nests). If they ask to "list shared workflows" or "find workflows", use `searchArtifacts`.

## When to Use Workflows

Workflows are for repeatable tasks. If it's a one-time thing, just execute it directly.

## Tracking Progress

Use TodoWrite during **both** workflow design and execution. The user sees your todo list — it's your primary way of keeping them informed.

- **When designing:** Create todos for your design steps (gather requirements, identify inputs/edge cases, draft workflow, write file, present for review).
- **When executing:** Create a todo for each workflow step and update status as you go. Add new todos if unexpected issues arise.

Keep todo titles short and scannable. Update them as you progress — don't leave stale todos sitting around.

## Workflow Format

Each workflow is a directory under `workflows/` containing a `SKILL.md` file with:
- **Frontmatter** (required): YAML frontmatter with `name` (lowercase-hyphenated slug that must match the directory name), `description` (always wrap in double quotes to avoid YAML parsing errors from colons or special characters), and optional `metadata` map.
- **Inputs**: Optional parameters with defaults
- **Steps**: Numbered steps with clear instructions
- **Output**: Optional template for the final result

When creating a new workflow, always include frontmatter with `name` (must match the directory name, lowercase with hyphens only), `description` (always in double quotes), and `metadata.createdAt` set to the current date/time in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2026-01-15T09:00:00Z`). Use `bash` (e.g., `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`) to get the current UTC time — do not guess or hardcode it.

**IMPORTANT:** Always wrap the `description` value in double quotes in the YAML frontmatter. Unquoted descriptions containing colons (`:`) cause YAML parsing errors. For example, write `description: "Analyze code: find and fix issues"` not `description: Analyze code: find and fix issues`.

**Name constraints:** lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only; no leading/trailing or consecutive hyphens; must match the directory name exactly.

### Example: Simple Review

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: "Review code changes for quality issues."
metadata:
  createdAt: "2026-01-15T09:00:00Z"
---

## Inputs

- **target** (optional): Files to review. Default: `.`

## Steps

### 1. Find Changes
Find all modified code files in {{input.target}}.

### 2. Review Code
Review these files for quality issues:
{{Find Changes}}

Focus on: error handling, edge cases, and readability.

## Output

{{Review Code}}
```

### Example: With Conditions

```markdown
---
name: smart-fix
description: "Analyze an issue and apply a fix only if it's safe to do so."
metadata:
  createdAt: "2026-01-15T09:00:00Z"
---

## Steps

### 1. Analyze Issue
Analyze the reported issue and determine severity.

### 2. Check Safety
Based on this analysis, determine if an automated fix is safe:
{{Analyze Issue}}

End your response with SAFE or UNSAFE.

### 3. Apply Fix
Apply the fix for: {{Analyze Issue}}

**Condition:** {{Check Safety}} contains SAFE

### 4. Create Manual Report
Create a report explaining why manual intervention is needed:
{{Analyze Issue}}

**Condition:** {{Check Safety}} contains UNSAFE
```

### Example: With Error Handling

```markdown
---
name: deploy-with-rollback
description: "Deploy changes with automatic rollback on failure."
metadata:
  createdAt: "2026-01-15T09:00:00Z"
---

## Inputs

- **environment** (required): Target environment (staging, production)

## Steps

### 1. Run Tests
Run the full test suite. Report any failures.

### 2. Deploy
Deploy to {{input.environment}}.

**On error:** Rollback

### 3. Verify
Verify the deployment is healthy.

**On error:** Rollback

### 4. Rollback
Roll back to the previous version and report what went wrong.

## Output

Deployment to {{input.environment}} complete.
{{Verify}}
```

## Key Concepts

**Variables:** Use `{{input.name}}` for inputs and `{{Step Name}}` for outputs from previous steps.

**Conditions:** Add `**Condition:**` to make a step run only when the condition is true. Common patterns:
- `{{Step Name}} contains X` - check if output contains text
- `{{Step Name}} not empty` - check if output exists
- `{{input.flag}} equals yes` - check exact value

**Error handling:** Add `**On error:**` to control what happens when a step fails:
- `stop` (default) - halt the workflow
- `continue` - log the error and move to the next step
- `Step Name` - jump to a specific step (useful for cleanup/rollback)

**Output:** The `## Output` section defines the final result. If omitted, the last step's output is used.

**File dependencies:** When a workflow depends on any files (scripts, templates, data files, configs, etc.), those files **must** be placed in the same directory as the workflow's `SKILL.md` file or in a subdirectory within it. Workflows are self-contained directories — files outside the workflow directory will not be available when the workflow is published, installed, or shared.

## Designing Workflows

When asked to create a workflow, DO NOT start writing it immediately. Follow this process:

### Phase 1: Understand

1. Use TodoWrite to create a plan for designing the workflow (e.g., "Gather requirements", "Identify inputs and edge cases", "Draft workflow", "Write to file", "Present for review").
2. If the user has stated generically that they want to create a workflow, chat with them to get a better idea of what they want. Don't use the AskUserQuestion tool at this phase.
3. Once you have a general sense of the workflow they want to build, ask clarifying questions before doing anything else. DO use the AskUserQuestion tool for these specific questions. You need to understand:
    - What the workflow should accomplish end-to-end
    - What the expected outcome is
    - What inputs/variables are needed
    - What external services or tools are involved
    - How errors should be handled (stop? retry?)
    - DON'T ask about execution frequency or external triggers because we don't yet support those features 
4. **Wait for answers. Do not proceed until you have enough information to design a good workflow.** Do not guess or assume — ask.

### Phase 2: Draft & Save

1. Once you understand the requirements, draft the workflow.
2. Create the directory `workflows/<name>/` and write the workflow to `workflows/<name>/SKILL.md`. Place any supporting files (scripts, data, etc.) alongside `SKILL.md` in the same directory.
3. Mark your design todos as complete.

### Phase 3: Hand Off

1. Present the workflow to the user with a brief summary of what each step does.
2. Ask the user to review it. Offer to make changes.
3. **Offer to execute the workflow — do NOT execute it automatically.** Say something like: "Want me to run this now, or would you like to make changes first?"

**IMPORTANT:** Never skip Phase 1. Never jump straight to writing. Never auto-execute after designing.

Use descriptive step names in title case (e.g., "Fetch Issues" not "step1") — these become variables for later steps.

For deterministic operations (data transformation, calculations), consider having steps use Python scripts (see `python-scripts` skill). For external services (Slack, Jira, databases), consider MCP servers (see `mcp-curl` skill).

## Executing Workflows

Users may ask to run a workflow at any time — not just immediately after designing one. Workflows in `workflows/` are persistent, reusable artifacts. A user might say "run the code-review workflow" days or weeks after it was created. Treat execution as a standalone operation: load the file, collect inputs, and run it. Don't assume you have any prior context about the workflow beyond what's in the file itself.

**IMPORTANT:** If the user asks you to *create* a workflow, do NOT auto-execute it after writing the file. Present it for review and offer to run it. But if the user asks you to *run* an existing workflow, go ahead — that's an explicit request.

**IMPORTANT:** Installed workflows live on the local filesystem in the `workflows/` directory. When running a workflow, ALWAYS load it from `workflows/<name>/SKILL.md`. Do NOT use `searchArtifacts` to find workflows to run — that tool searches the remote Obot registry for published artifacts, not locally installed workflows.

When the user asks you to run a workflow:

1. Load the workflow from `workflows/<name>/SKILL.md`. If you're unsure which workflows are available, use glob pattern `**/SKILL.md` with path `workflows/` to find them.
2. Use TodoWrite to create a todo for each workflow step before you begin. This is your execution plan — the user will follow along.
3. **Present the execution plan to the user.** After creating the todos, present a brief summary of what will be executed and ask the user to confirm before proceeding. For example: "I've planned the following steps: [list steps]. Does this look good to proceed?"
4. **Wait for user approval.** Do not begin execution until the user confirms.
5. Collect any required inputs from the user. If inputs are missing and have no defaults, ask for them.
6. Call `recordWorkflowRun` with the workflow URI (e.g. `workflow:///workflow-name`) to record the run in the current session.
7. Execute each step in order:
    - Check conditions before running conditional steps.
    - Interpolate variables (`{{input.name}}` and `{{Step Name}}`).
    - Follow error handling directives.
    - Mark each todo complete/failed/skipped as you go.
8. Provide running updates in normal chat messages as you work through each step. If errors occur, judgment calls are needed, or unexpected conditions arise, mention them in chat and add new todos as needed.

Complete tasks fully, follow requested formats exactly, and provide specific analysis rather than vague summaries.

After execution, present a structured run summary directly in chat:
- A heading with the workflow name and a pass/fail indicator (e.g., ## Workflow Run: Code Review)
- A tally of step outcomes (e.g., "3 of 3 steps succeeded" or "2 of 3 steps succeeded, 1 failed")
- For failed steps, a brief explanation of what went wrong
- A summary of any modifications made to external systems or artifacts produced
- If the workflow defines an Output section, include that content last

If the workflow was aborted or no steps completed, still produce a summary explaining what happened and which steps were skipped.

## Improving Workflows

After executing a workflow, you can analyze the execution and propose improvements to the workflow file.

**What to look for:**
- Steps that needed retries or failed — unclear prompt? missing format spec?
- Steps that produced poor output — missing context? too vague?
- Steps that should be split into smaller steps
- Missing error handling for steps that failed
- Hardcoded values that should be inputs

**Process:** Review which steps succeeded/failed/retried and what fixes were applied. For each issue, determine the concrete fix (rewrite prompt, add format spec, split step, add error handling, etc.). Present each proposed change with the issue, current text, and proposed text.

**IMPORTANT:** Get user approval before editing the workflow file. Never apply changes automatically.

**Example:**
```
## Proposed Changes to issue-triage.md

### 1. Step: Analyze Issues
**Issue:** Agent returned prose instead of JSON. Had to retry.
**Change:** Add explicit format requirement.

Current:
> Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.
> Return the results as JSON.

Proposed:
> Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.
>
> Return as a JSON array:
> [{"number": 1, "title": "...", "priority": "High|Medium|Low", "reason": "..."}]

Apply these changes? (yes/no/select specific)
```

Don't change things that worked fine or add complexity without a concrete problem to solve.

## Publishing & Sharing Workflows

You can publish workflows to Obot's registry so other users can discover and install them.

### Publishing

To publish a workflow, use the `publishArtifact` tool:

1. Ensure the workflow exists in `workflows/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` that has proper frontmatter (name, description). The workflow must pass format validation before publishing.
2. Call `publishArtifact` with the workflow directory name. For example: `publishArtifact({ "workflowName": "code-review" })`.
3. The tool bundles all files in the directory and uploads to Obot. The `SKILL.md` frontmatter is the source of truth for artifact metadata.
4. The first publish creates version 1. Subsequent publishes of the same workflow create new versions (v2, v3, etc.).
5. Version 1 starts owner-only unless its subjects are updated.
6. Each later published version defaults to the previous version's sharing settings.
7. To change who a specific published version is shared with, use `setArtifactSubjects({ "id": "<artifact-id>", "version": <n>, "subjects": [...] })`. If `version` is omitted, the latest version is updated.
8. Supported subjects are:
   - `{ "type": "user", "id": "<user-id>" }`
   - `{ "type": "group", "id": "<group-id>" }`
   - `{ "type": "selector", "id": "*" }` for all Obot users
9. An empty `subjects` list makes that version owner-only again.
10. To find valid user or group IDs before setting subjects, use `listSubjects({ "type": "user" | "group", "query": "..." })`. Leave `query` blank to list everything visible.

### Searching the Registry

To find published or shared workflows from other users in the **remote Obot registry**, use `searchArtifacts`:
- Search by keyword: `searchArtifacts({ "query": "code review", "artifactType": "workflow" })`
- List all shared workflows: `searchArtifacts({ "artifactType": "workflow" })` (empty query returns all visible artifacts)
- This is for discovering shared, public, or published workflows — not for finding workflows already on your local filesystem.
- **When a user asks about "shared workflows", this is the tool to use.**

### Installing

To install a published workflow, use `installArtifact`:
- `installArtifact({ "id": "<artifact-id>" })` installs the latest version
- `installArtifact({ "id": "<artifact-id>", "version": 2 })` installs a specific version
- The workflow is automatically extracted into `workflows/<name>/` and is immediately available.
- Installing overwrites any existing local workflow with the same name.
